	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js
	(onSubscriptionDialog): the "focus" event must be listened from
	the searchInput's inputField subelement in order to get caught.
	This would prevent tabfocus from cleaning the input.
	(onSearchInputKeyPress): we need to clean gSearchTimer when a
	search is launched by pressing "enter/return".
	(userReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete)
	(collectionReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete): we check the
	content-type of the result as well as its length prior to parse it
	as an XML document, to avoid exceptions.
	(userReportTarget.onDAVQueryComplete): a new element attribute
	("searching") is set to "notfound" when the query returned no
	result, enabling the setting of visual elements.
	(onStartSearch): we let the "throbber" spin when a search is
	performed.

2010-03-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-overlay.js
	(toggleShowOnlyCalendar): remove all calendars prior to adding the
	missing one in order to gain a slight performance increase in the
	rendering of the calendar view.

2010-03-19  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js

	calendars on calendars that we own.

2010-03-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js:
	"info" field can have multiple lines, which are then splitted and
	reassembled with a "; " separator.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/folders-update.js:
	check that "response" is non-null before processing, for sanity.

2010-03-10  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/properties-overlay.js
	(onLoadOverlay): we no longer disable the name field as we now
	permit the "renaming" of subscribed resources.

2009-12-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/folders-update.js
	(directoryChecker.checkAvailability): new methods that ensures
	that the corresponding SOGo module is available, by first
	executing an "OPTIONS" request on the container collection and
	then caching the result for further invocations.
	(checkFolders): make use of the new method above before triggering
	any SOGo-specific setup.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js
	(isCommandEnabled): make the acl commands unavailable if the
	"Calendar" module is not available in SOGo.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/addressbook/addressbook-overlay.js
	(SIOnLoadHandler): collapse the toolbar is the "Contacts" module
	is not available in SOGo.

2009-11-26  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-common-sets.js
	chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-common-sets.xul:
	new overlay to override the behavior of the "Delete Calendar"
	menu option - ie., to correctly differentiate delete vs. unsubscribe
	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendars-list-overlay.js
	We now correctly handle activation / desactivation of the menu
	items when dealing with local/webdav calendars
	* Bumped version to v0.98pre1

2009-11-12  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/sogo-config.js (sogoBaseURL):
	added the ability to specify another prefix than "/SOGo", based on
	the "sogo-integrator.sogo-prefix" preference.

2009-10-26  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/sogo-config.js

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-utils.js

2009-10-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js
	(SubscriptionTreeView.toggleOpenState: removed the "filter"
	element from the query and close the "collection-filter" element
	to produce a valid XML request. This solves a case were SOGo
	logged a "malformed <data> element".

2009-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/startup-overlay.js:
	discarded the change below, reenabling the SSL bug work-around.

2009-07-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/messenger/startup-overlay.js:
	certain unavailable calendars may not return an "onLoad" when the
	network is down. Since the update window is no longer modal, we
	can redisplay it unconditionnally without fearing a deadlock.

2009-07-15  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	*
	chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-summary-dialog.xul:
	new overlay, displaying the name of the item calendar in the upper
	right corner.

2009-07-08  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js: we no
	longer invoke the acl entry for the added calendars because this
	would interfere with our version of lightning, that already does
	that anyway.

2009-07-01  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js: we
	invoke the ACL entry for the corresponding calendar from the
	topmost window through setTimeout so that no XMLRequest error
	occurs when the calling window is closed.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-dialog.js:
	prevent users from subscribing twice to a folder they have already
	subscribed to. Put the current subscriptions in gray.

2009-06-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/folder-handler.js: we no
	longer invoke "calCalendarManager.registerCalendar" since creating
	a cached calendar will register it automatically.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/global/common-dialog-overlay.js:
	show the username being used to connect.

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-utils.js: fix
	a regexp so all special characters of username are properly replaced.

2009-05-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* chrome/content/sogo-integrator/general/subscription-utils.js: we

	avoid display problems with "non-pure" letters+digits usernames.

	* Bumped version number to 0.93

	Marco Lertora <marco.lertora@infoporto.it>

2009-01-13  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * We now offer a Delete Calendar / Unsubscribe From Calendar
	option from the contextual menu to avoid confusion for users

2008-12-08  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * chrome/content/sogo-integrator/calendar/calendar-event-dialog.js
	We strip the whitespaces when considering the length of the title

2008-12-08  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	We now warn the user about components w/o a title
	* We now offer an option to reload ACLs on calendar that we
	are not the owner and we also load the ACLs immediatly
	after adding a CalDAV calendar (using the subscribe feature)

2008-12-03  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

        * Added a new overlay in order to control the
	visibility of the "Send attendees inviation by email"
	checkbox from Lightning. You can now show/hide by setting
	the following preference:
	sogo-integrator.disable-send-invitations-checkbox
